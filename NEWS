breedR 0.10
==========

* Full internal refactoring (with few 'visible' changes in the interface)

* `model.matrix()` no longer separates `fixed` and `random` effects.
  It returns the same structure as `ranef()` which is more intuitive.

* `vcov()` works now with any of the non-diagonal random effects.

* Much more exhaustive testing assures greater stability.


breedR 0.9
==========

* New 'generic' model component allows passing a list of arbitrary incidence and covariance/precision matrices

* Optimized splines model. It runs about 5x faster.


breedR 0.8
==========

* New interface ranef() to access BLUP of random effects

* New interface model.matrix() to get incidence matrices

* Integrated vignettes into the package


breedR 0.7
==========

* Remote computing through ssh

* Convenient scaling of spatial variance components

* Additive genetic competition model

* Permanent environmental competition effect

* Simulation infrastructure


breedR 0.6
==========

* Visualization and diagnostic tools

* Prediction in unobserved locations


breedR 0.5
==========

* Customizable initial variance components

* breedR.option infrastructure


breedR 0.4
==========

* AR1xAR1 spatial model

* Eucalyptus Globulus dataset and demo


breedR 0.3
==========

* Pedigree checking, completing, sorting and recoding


breedR 0.2
==========

* Unstructured Random effects

* Simple simulation of spatially structured effects

* Spatial module following Cappa and Cantet (2007) splines model


breedR 0.1
==========

* Basic wrapper to Mistalz's (AI)REMLF90

* Convenient 'metagene' class to represent and manipulate simulated datasets
