```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(breedR)
library(ggplot2)
```

BreedR is an R-package that provides statistical models specifically suited for forest genetic resources analysts.
All of these models can be ultimately seen as a [Mixed Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model), however they are not necessarily easy to implement and use for real data analysis.
BreedR acts as an interface which provides the means to:

1. Combine any number of these models as components of a larger model
2. Compute automatically incidence and covariance matrices from a few input parameters
3. Fit the model
4. Plot data and results, and perform model diagnostics

The following is a conceptual map of breedR's functionality (future functionalities greyed-out):

Inference with breedR
---------------------

Currently, only frequentist inference is supported via REML estimation of variance components.

Use the function `remlf90()`, which provides an interface to both `REMLF90` and `AIREMLF90` functions in the [BLUPF90](http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php) suite of programs.


Mixed Models
------------

Let's simulate some data to work with.
We will include a global intercept of $5$, a fixed effect $x$ with a coefficient of 2, and one random factor $f_3$ with three independent levels. We fix the level values at `r -1:1`.

```{r simulate-data}
n  <- 1e3      # dataset size
mu <- 5        # a global mean
x <- runif(n)  # a covariate
# a factor with 3 levels and associated values
f3 <- factor(sample(letters[1:3], n, replace = TRUE))
f3.val <- (-1:1)[f3]
sigma2 <- .5   # residual variance
# linear predictor
eta    <- mu + 2*x + f3.val
# Simulated data
dat <- data.frame(eta, x, f3,
                  y = eta + rnorm(n, sd = sqrt(sigma2)))
```

Here is how the simulated dataset looks like

```{r dataset, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(dat))
```

We fit the corresponding model
$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = \mu + \beta x + f + \varepsilon \\
f & \sim N(0, \sigma_f^2) \\
\varepsilon & \sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

to the dataset by using `formula`s for the fixed and random terms.

```{r mixed-model}
res <- remlf90(fixed = y ~ x,
               random = ~ f3,
               data = dat)
```

Note that the intercept is automatically included (as usual in `R`), and that the LHS of the random formula should be empty.
The dataset must be always explicitly added.

To avoid the warning, initial values for *all* the variance components must be made explicit using the argument `var.ini`:

```{r mixed-model-varini}
res <- remlf90(fixed = y ~ x,
               random = ~ f3,
               var.ini = list(f3 = 2, resid = 10),
               data = dat)
```

Although in most cases the results will not change at all, we encourage to give explicit initial values for variance components.
Specially when some estimate can be [artifact](http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=readme.reml#does_remlf90_always_converge).
This is also useful for checking sensitivity to initial values.


### Exploring the results

The basic function is `summary` as usual in `R`.

```{r summary}
summary(res)
```

Note that `AI-REML` has been used by default. 
You can also specify `method = 'em'`.
Learn about the [difference](https://github.com/famuvie/breedR/wiki/Available-components-and-inference-methods).

Further functions give access to more specific results.
Some are already in the summary, some not.

```{r extraction}
fixef(res)
ranef(res)
extractAIC(res)
logLik(res)
str(resid(res))
qplot(dat$eta, fitted(res)) + 
  geom_abline(int = 0, sl = 1, col = 'darkgrey')
```



Additive genetic effect
-----------------------

We will use a [`metagene`](http://www.igv.fi.cnr.it/noveltree/) simulated dataset with known additive genetic variance and Breeding Values, for the purpose of demonstration.

```{r metagene}
data(m1)
summary(m1)
```


```{r genetic}
dat <- as.data.frame(m1)  # m1 has lots of info, which usually is not there
ped <- get_pedigree(m1)   # this works only for metagene objects

# this is the usual way to build a pedigree from an observed dataset
# build_pedigree completes the missing information (e.g. founders)
ped <- build_pedigree(c('self', 'dad', 'mum'), 
                      data = dat)

check_pedigree(ped)  # performs pedigree sanity checks
str(ped)

# Fit an animal model with sex as a fixed effect
# Note that sex must be a *factor*
# otherwise, it would be interpreted as a regressor
res <- remlf90(fixed  = phe_X ~ sex,
               genetic = list(model = 'add_animal', 
                              pedigree = ped,
                              id = 'self'), 
               data = dat)
summary(res)

PBV <- res$genetic$fit  # Predicted Breeding Values

# Predicted genetic values vs. true Breeding values by sex
qplot(BV_X, PBV, color = sex, data = dat) +
  geom_abline(int = 0, slope = 1, col = 'gray')

# Linear correlation between true and fitted breeding values
cor(dat$BV_X, PBV)
```
