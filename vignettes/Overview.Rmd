BreedR is an R-package that provides statistical models specifically suited for forest genetic resources analysts.
All of these models can be ultimately seen as a [Mixed Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model), however they are not necessarily easy to implement and use for real data analysis.
BreedR acts as an interface which provides the means to:
1. Combine any number of these models as components of a larger model
2. Compute automatically incidence and covariance matrices from a few input parameters
3. Fit the model
4. Plot data and results, and perform model diagnostics

The following is a conceptual map of breedR's functionality (future functionalities greyed-out):
