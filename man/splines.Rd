\title{Build a splines model}
\usage{
splines(coord, n.knots = NULL, autofill = TRUE, degree = 3,
  sparse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coord}{matrix(-like) of observation coordinates}

\item{n.knots}{numeric. Vector of length two with an integer number of knots
in each dimension.}

\item{autofill}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default) it will try to fill gaps in
the rows or columns. Otherwise, it will treat gaps the same way as adjacent
rows or columns.}

\item{degree}{integer. Degree of the B-spline polynomials.}

\item{sparse}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the incidence matrix will be stored in
  sparse format. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements \code{incidence.matrix}, \code{structure.matrix}
  and \code{structure.type}, which is a string indicating either
  \code{covariance} or \code{precision}.
}
\description{
Given the coordinates of the observations, and the degree, this function puts
into place a sensible number of spline knots and computes the incidence
matrix B and the covariance matrix U
}
\details{
Relies on \code{splines::splineDesign()}, which uses a C function call to
compute the splines coefficients.

\code{sparse} matrices take less memory, but also take longer to compute
with. This is probably convenient only for really big datasets in comparison
with RAM size. The covariance matrix is always stored in sparse format, as it
is particularly sparse.
