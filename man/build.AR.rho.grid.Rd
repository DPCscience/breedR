\title{Build an evaluation grid for the autoregressive parameters of rows and columns}
\usage{
build.AR.rho.grid(rho)
}
\description{
One or both autoregressive parameters may be unknown.
In that case we need to fit the model with several values of rho_r and rho_c,
in order to estimate the most likely values.
This functions provides an evaluation grid of values.
