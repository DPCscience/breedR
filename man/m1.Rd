\title{A small Metagene synthesized dataset}
\description{
Simulated progeny of one single generation under phenotypic selection and spatial arrangement.
The dataset includes the true Breeding values, the environmental effect and the observed phenotype for 1760 individuals.
}
\details{
The generation of founders (generation 0) consist in 80 independent couples, each of which produces 20 descendants (10 of each sex).

The full dataset contains data for the \eqn{2\times 80 + 1600 = 1760}{2*80 + 1600 = 1760} simulated individuals.
However, the Metagene program does not simulate phenotypes for the founders.

The 1600 descendants were arranged at random in a \eqn{40\times 40}{40 x 40} spatial grid

  plot(m1, type = 'spatial')

  # The phenotypes are noisy observations around the
  # true Breeding values with a standard deviation of about 7.3.
