breedR.sample.phenotype(fixed = NULL, random = NULL, genetic = NULL,
  spatial = NULL, residual.variance, N = NULL)

breedR.sample.AR(size, rho, sigma2, N = 1)

breedR.sample.splines(coord, nkn, sigma2, N = 1)

\arguments{
\item{fixed}{a numeric vector of regression coefficients.}

\item{N}{numeric. Number of samples to be drawn.}

\item{size}{numeric. A vector of length two with the number of rows and
columns}

\item{rho}{numeric. A vector of length two with the autocorrelation
parameters for the row and column autoregressive processes}

\item{sigma2}{numeric. The marginal variance}

\item{size}{numeric. A vector of length two with the number of rows and
columns}

\item{nkn}{numeric. A vector of length two with the number of knots in each
dimension parameters for the row and column autoregressive processes}

\item{sigma2}{numeric. The marginal variance}

\item{ped}{a pedigree object}

\item{Sigma}{numeric. The additive genetic variance. Either a variance for a
single additive genetic effect, or a matrix with the covariance structure for a set of
correlated genetic effects}

\item{Nobs}{numeric. Number of individuals to sample}

\item{Nparents}{numeric. Vector of length two. Number of fathers and mothers
to randomly mate.}

\item{check.factorial.}{logical. If TRUE, checks whether all the possible
matings had taken place at least once.}
}
\description{
These functions allow to draw samples from several models
  (spatial, genetic, competition, etc.) and to combine them to produce a
  simulated phenotype. The resulting dataset can then be fitted with breedR
  to compare the estimations with the true underlying parameters.
}
\details{
\code{breedR.sample.AR} simulates a two-dimensional spatial process
  as the kronecker product of first-order autoregressive processes in each
  dimension.

\code{breedR.sample.splines} simulates a two-dimensional spatial
  process as the kronecker product of B-splines processes in each dimension.

\code{breedR.sample.BV} simulates a set of breeding values (BV) given a pedigree

\code{breedR.sample.pedigree} simulates a one-generation pedigree
  from random mating of independent founders
