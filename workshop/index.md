June 29 – July 3 2015

Jaca, Spain


#### Preliminary tasks

Participants are expected to bring their laptops and have the following
tasks done, if needed, before the workshop

- Install and get familiar with R
  - Download and install from <http://cran.r-project.org/>
  - It is recommended to also install
    [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) as a user interface
  - At the very least, take a
    [crash-course](http://spatial.ly/2013/05/crash/) on R
  - or take this 4-hour introductory course on R from
    [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
  - or find some tutorial that suits you among the comprehensive
    contributed [documentation](http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html), even in
    [other
    languages](http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html#nenglish)
  - Bookmark [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) as a reference
    site for help
- Install the latest version of breedR
  - Follow instructions in <http://famuvie.github.io/breedR/>
  - Join our discussion
    [group](http://groups.google.com/group/breedr)
- Bring your datasets and prepare your questions
